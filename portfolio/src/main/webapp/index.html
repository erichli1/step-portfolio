      <h1>Eric's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>I'm an incoming sophomore at Harvard studying Computer Science and Economics. From Houston Texas, I'm passionate about economic development and technology, and in my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, dancing along to hip-hop music, and hanging out with friends.</p>

        <li>A mental health journaling app that used sentiment analysis to track users' emotions over time</li>
      </ol>
